Hello, I am Kadir Yazıcı, I was born in 2001 and living in
Kocaeli/Turkey. I am a self-taught frontend web developer but I
developed some basic backend apps too. I am a person who started to
learn HTML when I was 13 years old, I would steal source code of
websites I like and edit them. I am a TypeScript enjoyer and JavaScript
hater, I like coding in TypeScript, making user interfaces and making
user experiences.

I like to play Celeste a lot, I even inspired this website's theme from
Celeste.
